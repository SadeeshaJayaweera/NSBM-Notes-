								<h6>About Me</h6>
								<p>
									
									As a first-year computing undergraduate of <a href="https://nsbm.ac.lk"> NSBM Green University</a> , I have had the opportunity to develop a website showcasing the wonders of Sri Lanka. Using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, I have created a visually appealing and user-friendly platform to attract more tourists to this beautiful country.
									
									The main aim of the website is to highlight the incredible attractions and experiences that Sri Lanka has to offer.
